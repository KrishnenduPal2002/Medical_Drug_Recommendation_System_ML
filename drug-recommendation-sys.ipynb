       "0                                 I used to take another oral contraceptive, which had 21 pill cycle, and was very happy- very light periods, max 5 days, no other side effects. But it contained hormone gestodene, which is not available in US, so I switched to Lybrel, because the ingredients are similar. When my other pills ended, I started Lybrel immediately, on my first day of period, as the instructions said. And the period lasted for two weeks. When taking the second pack- same two weeks. And now, with third pack things got even worse- my third period lasted for two weeks and now it&#039;s the end of the third week- I still have daily brown discharge.\\r\\nThe positive side is that I didn&#039;t have any other side effects. The idea of being period free was so tempting... Alas.  \n",

I&#039;m glad I went with the patch, I have been on it for 8 months. At first It decreased my libido but that subsided. The only downside is that it made my periods longer (5-6 days to be exact) I used to only have periods for 3-4 days max also made my cramps intense for the first two days of my period, I never had cramps before using birth control. Other than that in happy with the patch  \n",
       "2                                                     I had been on the pill for many years. When my doctor changed my RX to chateal, it was as effective. It really did help me by completely clearing my acne, this takes about 6 months though. I did not gain extra weight, or develop any emotional health issues. I stopped taking it bc I started using a more natural method of birth control, but started to take it bc I hate that my acne came back at age 28. I really hope symptoms like depression, or weight gain do not begin to affect me as I am older now. I&#039;m also naturally moody, so this may worsen things. I was in a negative mental rut today. Also I hope this doesn&#039;t push me over the edge, as I believe I am depressed. Hopefully it&#039;ll be just like when I was younger.  \n",

It doesn&#039;t seem to work for everyone, but is a lifesaver for me.  I had a headache for 3 days when I started it and lost my appetite for a week.  After that it was fine.  I can get by on 200mg if I need to, but feel tired still most of the day (but won&#039;t fall asleep unless I want to).   My usual dose is 300mg which keeps me alert and I can&#039;t even take a nap if I want to.  \\\n",

No more trouble sleeping than normal. No shakiness or jitters, appetite seems normal. One tablet (150mg) was no help. I seem to be more productive during the day. No nausea or headaches, dizziness. I feel like I get along with it just fine.   \n",
       "152559  Diagnosed with Hypersomnia.  Prescribed 150 mg Nuvigil 1 x day.  This medication made me extremely talkative for the first few days to the point of annoyance to others and even myself.  Though it curbed my extreme need for napping and did make me feel somewhat more &#039;alive&#039; during the day, the side effects, for me, far outweighed the benefits. Chills, daily headaches, feeling feverish with no temperature throughout the two months I took Nuvigil.  Daily stomach pain and irritability and changes in my behavior to include sadness and crying episodes, feeling overwhelmed, feelings as if I were &#039;losing it&#039;.  I stopped taking Nuvigil two wks ago and no more side effects!!!!   \n",

My dentist spent hours trying to figure out why he could not get me numb before he made the connection.  Be forewarned that this is a potential problem.  This drug all in all has improved the quality of my life drastically. 7 years and topped at 90 mg. I hit tolerance a long time ago, but it still does what it was designed to do.  I am not looking for a high,  I am looking for a life with alertness and this medicine has given me that. I personally trust this older proven medication.    \n",
